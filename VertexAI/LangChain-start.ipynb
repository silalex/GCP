    "# Lab: Document Question Answering with AI Applications Search and LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab guides how to ask and answer questions about your data by combining a AI Applications Search engine with LLMs. In particular, we focus on querying 'unstructured' data such as PDFs and HTML files.\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns are useful if you have a AI Applications Search Engine pointed at a store of documents, such as a Google Cloud Storage bucket containing PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab focuses on utilize Gemini for Developers in the following ways:\n",
    " 1. A question about uploaded documents, receive answers with citations.\n",
    " 2. Engage in follow-up questions for deeper understanding.\n",
    " 3. Have the flexibility to customize prompts for tailored responses.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Task 1. Open Python Notebook and Install Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "In your Google Cloud project, navigate to Vertex AI Workbench. In the top search bar of the Google Cloud console, enter Vertex AI Workbench, and click on the first result."
