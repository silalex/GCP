    "## Objectives\n",
    "In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "- Parse documents using Document AI and chunk them into retrievable formats.\n",
    "- Generate embeddings with the Vertex AI Embeddings API.\n",
    "- Store and search vector data using Vertex AI Vector Search.\n",
    "- Re-rank retrieved content with the Vertex AI Ranking API.\n",
    "- Generate grounded answers using Gemini 2.0 Flash.\n",
    "- Validate generated answers using the Check Grounding API.\n",
    "- Use LangChain to orchestrate the end-to-end RAG pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1. Set up Vertex AI Workbench and install dependencies\n",
    "In this task, you enable necessary APIs in the Google Cloud Console, open Vertex AI Workbench, and create a Jupyter notebook. They install required dependencies, restart the kernel, and initialize Vertex AI in the notebook, printing version information for the SDKs and APIs."

Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services and Google Workspace (formerly known as G Suite) collaboration tools. Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sale of internet services as well as licensing and R&amp;D services. Unallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal, including fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared research and development activities. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs. 10<br><br> <b><a href=\"\">Source: gs://cloud-samples-data/gen-app-builder/search/alphabet-investor-pdfs/2021Q1<em>alphabet</em>earnings_release.pdf</a></b></h1></p>\n",
